## Some Content for types of Lymphoma
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is derived from white blood cells that grow in an
 uncontrolled, slow manner. Therefore, FL is considered an indolent disease 
that may require treatment. FL is the most common slow-growing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow 
makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). Chronic lymphocytic
 leukemia (also called CLL) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow that usually
 gets worse slowly. CLL is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults
 
 Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) results from a malignant transformation of a B lymphocyte
 in the outer edge of a lymph node follicle (the mantle zone). The transformed 
B lymphocyte grows in an uncontrolled way, resulting in the accumulation of
 lymphoma cells, which causes enlargement of lymph nodes.
 
 Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).  NHL is a cancer of the lymphatic system. It develops when the body makes abnormal  B lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that normally help to  fight infections.
 
 
 Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (also known as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, NHL, or sometimes 
just lymphoma) is a cancer that starts in white blood cells called lymphocytes, which are 
part of the body's immune system. NHL is a term that's used for many different types of
 lymphoma that all share some of the same characteristics.
