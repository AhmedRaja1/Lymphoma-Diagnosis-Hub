Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) results from a malignant transformation of a B lymphocyte
 in the outer edge of a lymph node follicle (the mantle zone). The transformed 
B lymphocyte grows in an uncontrolled way, resulting in the accumulation of
 lymphoma cells, which causes enlargement of lymph nodes.
